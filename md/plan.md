Here's a description of the details I put in the sketch:

Top Bar (Header):

X (Close): Represents the typical "exit" or "close" button, often with a subtle "Close" label next to it.

[========= 20=========40] : Added an XP (Experience Points) indicator, common in Duolingo, showing the user's current points.
 A progress bar, more clearly indicating a filled portion (20) out of a total (40), representing lesson progress, and it is going until it finish the whole lesson it get the 40ex , the progress bar is a live showing of how much we went on the lesson and until now how many ex we get.

⚡ 25 (Hearts): A clearer visual for the "hearts" or "lives" system, common in Duolingo, with a small "Hearts" label for clarity.

Horizontal Line: A more defined line separating the header from the main content.


Duolingo Character:

I've tried to make the character more recognizable as a stylized owl/person often seen in Duolingo. It includes:

A distinct head shape with "o o" for eyes and "^" for a nose/beak.

A body with "O O" as the main part and a "_" for a stomach/base.

Small arms indicated by ( ) and feet indicated by .' and . Note ( don ot make this character just leave a space for it , after that i will give you the character image or video to put in there)

Speech Bubble:

A more defined speech bubble shape, typically associated with characters speaking.

🔊 (Speaker Icon): Clearly indicates that the Arabic text is also audibly played, a core Duolingo feature.

Input Lines:

__________________________________________________________________________________: Three distinct lines are provided, implying where the user would type or drag words to form their translation, consistent with Duolingo's interface.

Word Bank:

(Interactive Word Bank Buttons): Added a label to indicate that these are clickable elements, not just static text.

The words are enclosed in square brackets [ ] to simulate buttons.

"CHECK" Button: we cannot click the check button until we put a word in the line.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+: A larger, more prominent button outline, reflecting its importance at the end of the exercise.

(Large "CHECK" Button): A label to describe its function and appearance.

The "CHECK" text is centered within the button.

IF HE PUT THE WORDS ANSD IT CORRECT THIS IS WILL HAPPEN 

THE check button change to a boarder like this
